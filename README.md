# PrinciplesChemProcesses II Syllabus

Course No.	CHE06 202

## Course Description -

Prerequisites:
Undergraduate level PCP I CHE 06201 Minimum Grade of C- and Undergraduate level Chemistry II CHEM 06101 Minimum Grade of D-  

This course is a continuation of Principles of Chemical Processes I. It will describe energy concepts for chemical processes. This course presents energy balances for chemically non-reacting and reacting systems and will show students how to use property tables and diagrams. Computer-aided material and energy balance calculations will be performed. Transient material and energy balances will be introduced. Demonstrations may be integrated throughout the course.

## Objectives -

The following is a partial list of objectives that you are expected to master by the end of this course. 

- Perform an unsteady-state mass balance on a system with an inlet and outlet.  Solve using Python
- Perform an energy balance on a closed or open system using enthalpy tables with a given reference state.
- Define the terms closed process system, open process system, isothermal process, adiabatic process, internal energy, enthalpy, heat capacity, heat of vaporization, heat of fusion, absolute humidity, relative humidity, dry and wet bulb temperature, and heat of reaction. 
- Using the steam tables calculate the amount of steam required to heat a process fluid from 20°C to 190°C in a heat exchanger.
- Perform vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations for systems containing one condensable component and for ideal multicomponent solutions.
- Calculate internal energy and enthalpy changes for process fluids undergoing specified changes in temperature, pressure, phase, and chemical composition. Incorporate the results of these calculations into process material and energy calculations.
- Estimate the heat capacity of a liquid using both Kopp’s rule and the Chueh and Swanson Method from Perry's Chemical Engineering Handbook.
- Determine the amount of liquid water that must be sprayed into a 100 lb/hr air stream to cool it from 400°F to 120°F using the psychrometric chart.
- Determine the heat duty required for a continuous isothermal reactor.
- Predict the outlet temperature for an endothermic reaction in a continuous adiabatic reactor.
- Use spreadsheets (EXCEL), an equation-solving program (Python) and a chemical simulation program (ASPEN) to solve material and energy balance problems.
- Work effectively in problem-solving teams, and carry out meaningful performance assessments of individual team members.

## Assignments -

Submit pdf and Jupyter Notebook *yourname.jpnyb and/or ASPEN *yourname.bkp file (Remember make plots using excel)

### From the Syllabus:

### Computers:  Homework Assignments using Computers

a) Show how the problem was set up for the computer program using hand written equations.  This includes a diagram of the physical dimensions of the problem and the equations and known values that will be input into the program.

b) Show sample calculations (with units) for each spreadsheet or Python calculation on engineering paper. 

c) Do not printout raw data from data acquisition experiments.  A summary of the data in the form of a table and/or a graphical presentation of this data is sufficient unless otherwise requested from the professor.

d) For homework requiring Python, the following additional documents are required:
  <ol>
  i) A Jupyter Notebook file:  *yourname.ipnyb file. 

  ii) A pdf file of the Jupyter Notebook. Only one pdf file must be submitted. (Paste output into a word document containing all tables and graphs required for a particular homework and convert to a pdf.  Use Adobe Acrobat to combine pdf files.

  iii) A summary table of the iterations required for a solution and any trials required for the solution.  The solution should be identified in the pdf and boxed.  It should not just be a number on the printout.  If requested the program file may need to be uploaded on blackboard. 

  iv)  Do not use an analytical solution as an aid to obtain a numerical solution to an identical problem.  The goal in this class is to compare the analytical solution to a numerical solution to gain an understanding of the capabilities of numerical solutions.
  </ol>
e) For homework requiring ASPEN:  
  i) A summary table of the solution 
  ii) a process flow diagram
  iii) electronic file uploaded on blackboard or otherwise instructed by professor.

f) For homework requiring COMSOL:  i) handwritten setup of the problem showing geometry and equations ii) required graphs and tables iii) electronic *.mph file uploaded on blackboard or otherwise instructed by professor

### Electronic Submissions

All answers submitted electronically (e.g. Canvas) must be in a single pdf file for the entire assignment.  For example if there are 3 problems, then there will be 3 problem answers in the one pdf file that are placed in the order assigned.  Hand calculations can be scanned and inserted into the document.  All material including required graphs, must be placed in consecutive pages.  Beyond the initial electronic document, points will be subtracted for each electronic file that is required to be opened to see the work of the student.  If using MS word as the electronic document, convert to pdf before submitting.  Please do not upload a zip file since feedback can not be given using Canvas tools.
